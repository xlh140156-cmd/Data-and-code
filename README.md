# ATSD-LT Minimal Reproducible Package

This repository provides a **complete, lightweight, and fully reproducible** demonstration of the core workflow presented in the ATSD-LT study:

- **Adaptive Time-Scale Decomposition (ATSD)**  
- A compact **LSTM-based multi-component prediction model**  
- Standard **evaluation metrics** (MAE, RMSE, R², MASE)

All implementations are intentionally simplified to ensure fast execution and easy reproducibility, without the full-scale hyperparameter configurations used in the original paper.

## Quick Start – Full Workflow (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Perform ATSD decomposition (generates atsd_components.nmz)
python atsd_demo.py

# 2. Train the compact LSTM model and generate predictions
python train_model_demo.py

# 3. Evaluate results and save metrics
python evaluate.py
```

After running these three commands, you will obtain:

- `atsd_components.npz` – decomposed time-scale components  
- `y_true.npy` / `y_pred.npy` – ground truth and predictions  
- `metrics.csv` – final performance metrics

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Minimal dependencies (requirements.txt):**

```
numpy
scipy
tensorflow>=2.10
scikit-learn
pandas
```

(Compatible with Python 3.8–3.11)

---

## Customization

- **Use your own data**: Replace the synthetic series generation block in `atsd_demo.py` with your own 1-D time series (NumPy array of shape `(T,)` or `(T,1)`).
- **Adjust decomposition parameters**: Modify `n_imfs` or other ATSD arguments directly in `atsd_demo.py`.
- **Change model architecture**: Edit `train_model_demo.py` (e.g., number of LSTM layers, units, sequence length).

---

## Notes

- The demo uses **synthetic data** by default for full reproducibility without external datasets.
- Execution time on a standard laptop: < 30 seconds for the entire pipeline.
- No proprietary code, sensitive hyperparameters, or large pretrained weights are included.
- This minimal version achieves the same methodological flow as the full experimental setup, making it ideal for reviewers, replication studies, or educational purposes.
