# ATSD-LT: Minimal Reproducible Example

This repository contains a complete, lightweight, and fully executable minimal reproducible package that demonstrates the core methodology of the ATSD-LT framework presented in our forthcoming paper. It includes:

- Adaptive Time-Scale Decomposition (ATSD) for multi-scale signal separation  
- A compact multi-input LSTM model that predicts the original series from the decomposed components  
- Standard evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, R², and MASE  

All scripts have been deliberately simplified and stripped of large-scale hyperparameter search, heavy data augmentation, and ensemble strategies used in the full experiments, so that the entire pipeline can be executed in seconds on any standard laptop.

## How to Run the Entire Pipeline (Three Commands)

```bash
# Step 1: Perform Adaptive Time-Scale Decomposition
python data_processing/atsd_demo.py

# Step 2: Train the lightweight LSTM model and generate predictions
python models/train_model_demo.py

# Step 3: Compute evaluation metrics
python evaluate.py
```

After completion, open `metrics.csv` to see MAE, RMSE, R², and MASE values.

Typical runtime on a regular laptop/CPU: **15–30 seconds** for the full three-step workflow.

## Environment Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages (kept intentionally minimal):

```
numpy
scipy
tensorflow>=2.10
scikit-learn
pandas
```

Tested and confirmed working on Python 3.8–3.11 (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Using Your Own Data

The current example uses synthetic data for full out-of-the-box reproducibility. To apply the method to your own univariate time series:

1. Place your series (as a 1-D NumPy array or CSV with a single column) into the `data/` folder, or  
2. Modify the data-loading section near the top of `data_processing/atsd_demo.py`.

No other changes are required—the rest of the pipeline will run unchanged.

The complete source code, full-scale training configurations, extensive ablation studies, and all real-world datasets used in the paper will be released after formal publication. Upon reasonable request, they can be obtained by contacting the corresponding author.
